this was made cuz of a modworkshop addon using chatgpt to make it. the goal of that mod was to set your hp to 1 and remove your armor and what not.

problem is, it did that through one of the most stupidest and most convoluted pieces of code i think i've ever seen...so i made this to show how little
code you actually need to accomplish this.

now i haven't playtested this, probably crashes you, but if not, the result should be that you have 1 hp, 0 armor, no grace period, some skills aree
changed. (uppers no longer auto revives, nine lives aced does nothing.)
